	<p>Some of this years highlights were reading Macbeth in English class and listening to the Serial podcast in Law and Society. I also enjoyed learning about the French Revolution in History and titrations in Chemistry. Some of the math and Spanish tests were difficult, but I enjoyed when we learned about the culture of the Dominican Republic in Spanish. </p>
